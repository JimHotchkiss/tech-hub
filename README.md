This is a rebuild of the MSA application. The name will be changed to the Tech HUB App. 

This rebuild will leverage object oriented design, in order to make the code easier to service, troubleshoot and scale. 


# File structure - src/
* index.js File - this is the file that will kickoff our application
* Adapter Folder - the adapter folder will house objects that communicate with the data. 
* Components Folder - the components folder will house objects that render the data

# Order and details of the files executed 
1.) We have an index.js - This is the file that will kick off our application
2.) In index.js, we instantiate a new instance of the App class
3.) The App class does one thing, and that is to, in its constructor(), instantiate an instance of landingPage
4.) in the LandingPage class, we instantiate an instance of our adapter: LandingPageAdapter
    a. The LandingPage class has a couple instance variables and a method
    b. The 'feature' varialbe is instantiated as an empty array
    c. The 'adapter' is variable that is created by calling the LandingPageAdapter class
    d. The 'fetchAndLoadLandingpageFeatures()' method, fetches the data
    e. Once the 'adapter', using the 'getLandingPageFeatures()' method has connected to the api, the collection of objects is than saved to the 'feature' variable 
    g. The feature objects are then rendered to the landing page, throught the 'render()' method
    h. We also have a navbar class.
        i.) This class has a 'renderNavbar()' method that is called in the LandpingPage class
        ii.) It also has a 'updateNavbar()' method. This method will be used to update the navbar to reflect changes in icons, text and functionality.
5.) Our LandingPageAdapter connects to the backend, in this case, our landingPageJson file

# Feature class 
1.) When the user selects a feature from the landing page, a new Feature is instantiated
2.) The Feature class has a number of instances variables that are created when a Feature is created.
    a. This is includes the id, title, icon url and description
3.) A FeatureAdapter is instantiated, when a Feature is created, and this FeatureAdapter is passed an argument of the feature.id
    a. The FeatureAdapter, with the feature id, makes a fetch request to the api of the particular feature to retrieve that feature's data
4.) An instance method, clearLandingPage(), is also created.    
    a. This clears the landing page's Html
5.) Once clearLandingPage() has been executed, other methods are executed
    a. The data associated with feature fetched and loaded with the fethAndLoadFeatureComponents() method
    b. The feature components are then rendered to the DOM with the renderComponents() method
6.) An instance method of updateNavbar() is instantiate. This is done by creating a new Navbar and calling on that class the 'updateNavbar()' class method.
    a.) This will update text, icons and even functionality, when necessary. 
7.) When a use selects a ccu, monitor or specialty, the Feature method 'assignUsersSelectionAndResetFeature()' is called
    a.) The method assigns the user selections to the instance variable 'selections'.
        i.) The 'selection' variable keeps track of the users selection 
            # Note - Perhaps I could use local storage for this 
    b.) And then clears the HTML, and then the 'updateFeaturePage()' method is called
        i.) The 'collections' variable is called, and the users selection is matched with the corresponding data
        ii.) Then the 'renderComponents()' method is called
    
# ResetNavbarAndFeature class
8.) The ResetNavbarAndFeature class handles the functionality of reseting the navbar and feature page.    
    a.) The ResetNavbarAndFeature class has a couple instance methods
        i.) 'resetNavbar()' - resets the HTML in the navbar
        ii.) 'resetFeature()' - resets the HTML in the feature section
        iii) 'renderNewLandingPage()' - this calls an instance of the class Landing page



// Note: 1/15/21 Started to build a 'updateNavbar' module. Not sure if it will keep 
    # Update: I want to be able to define a method, in the Navbar object, call 'updateNavbar', and call this method in other locations of the app. 


// 'return' statement ends function execution, and specifies a value to be returned to the function caller
